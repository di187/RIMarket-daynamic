Irreversible electroporation is a soft tissue ablation technique using ultra short but strong electrical fields to create permanent and hence lethal Nano pores in the cell membrane, to disrupt the cellular homeostasis. The resulting cell death results from apoptosis and not necrosis as in all other thermal or radiation based ablation techniques. The main use of IRE lies in tumor ablation in regions where precision and conservation of the extracellular matrix, blood flow and nerves are of importance. The technique is in an experimental stage and has not been approved for use outside of clinical trials. IRE is used in the NanoKnife System.
