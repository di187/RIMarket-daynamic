# Singapore Respiratory Humidifying Equipment Market Latest Statistics, Future Dynamics And Tendencies By Region

<strong>Respiratory Humidifying Equipment Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Respiratory humidification is a process of warming, purification, and humidification of the respiratory gas artificially. The lung tissues start getting damaged due to dryness of the organs when the natural humidification fails. Thus, respiratory humidification is carried out for mechanically ventilated patients. An artificial respiration causes the epithelial mucus layer to become more viscous in a short time, impairing the ciliary function inside the nose. Thus to prevent such complications, the loss of heat and moisture are compensated by the humidification process. The humid air is provided to the nasal mucosa at 37 degrees Celsius (room temperature), with adjusted 100% relative humidity to maintain mucociliary clearance for long time.

Respiratory humidifiers are used to heat and humidify the air of patients whose breathing is assisted by a ventilator in Intensive Care Units (ICU). The air must be conditioned to 37°C and at least 90% relative humidity. Over-humidification or under-humidification can lead to blocked airways, lung damage and infection.
